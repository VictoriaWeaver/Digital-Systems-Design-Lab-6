Design and Verification of an SRAM with Memory Controller.

Implementation of an SRAM unit.  Capable of executing write, read, and burst read (read four consecutive addresses) commands.  The SRAM contains eight addresses (vectors "000" - "111") which hold 4-bit data values.  The memory controller is a Moore Finite State Machine that controls the execution of commands.  The unit is successfully simulated in ModelSim and executed on a Digilent Nexys 3 Spartan 6 FPGA.
